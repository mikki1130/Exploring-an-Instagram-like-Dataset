# Exploring-an-Instagram-like-Dataset
This project involves the exploration and analysis of a dataset resembling Instagram's structure, focusing on user behavior, posts, interactions, and network dynamics. The dataset includes information on users, their posts, likes, comments, and followers, providing an opportunity to perform various data analysis tasks.
