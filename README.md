# Exploring-an-Instagram-like-Dataset
This project involves the exploration and analysis of a dataset resembling Instagram's structure, focusing on user behavior, posts, interactions, and network dynamics. The dataset includes information on users, their posts, likes, comments, and followers, providing an opportunity to perform various data analysis tasks.


# OBJECTIVE
The objective of this project is to explore and analyze an Instagram-like dataset to gain insights into user behavior, content engagement, and network dynamics. By performing data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization, this project aims to uncover patterns and trends within the dataset that can inform strategies for enhancing user engagement, optimizing content, and understanding social media interactions. This analysis also serves as a practical application of data analysis techniques, providing a foundation for further exploration in social media data science.

# ABOUT DATA
This dataset is modeled after the structure and interactions typically found on Instagram. It contains several tables that represent various aspects of user activity, content, and social interactions on the platform. Below is a detailed description of each table and the data they contain:

* users: Contains user information such as usernames and creation timestamps.

* photos: Stores details about posted photos, including image URLs and user IDs.

* comments: Stores comments made on photos, along with associated user and photo IDs.

* likes: Tracks user likes on photos.

* follows: Records user follow relationships.

* tags: Manages unique tag names for photos.

* photo_tags: Links photos with associated tags.

# ANALYSIS LIST
User Demographics and Account Activity

* Analyze the distribution of user account creation dates.
* Post Content Analysis
* Analyze the average length of captions and their impact on engagement.
* Engagement Analysis
* Analyze the distribution of likes and comments across different user groups.
* Follower-Following Network Analysis

# APPROACH USED
# Data Wrangling:
This is the first step where inspection of data is done to make sure NULL values and missing values are detected and data replacement methods are used to replace missing or NULL values.

Build a database
Create a table and insert the data.
Select columns with null values in them. There are no null values in our database as in creating the tables, we set NOT NULL for each field, hence null values are filtered out.
# Feature Engineering:
This will help us generate some new columns from existing ones.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Exploratory data analysis is done to answer the business questions and aims of this project.


# REQUIREMENTS
